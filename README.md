# commit-messages-project
Hi! It's my first repository and it's for my graduation project.

This repository is created for my graduation project "Estimation technique to determine the quality of commit mesagges in open-source projects" at Saint Petersburg State University.

As a result of the estimation technique I determined following metrics:
  1. The length of summary line must be less than 50 characters.
  2. Summary line and body do not have to end up by -ed, -s.
  3. The string of summary line must begin from capitalized letter.
  4. Commit message must contain reference to ticket/issues (such as #NO-243, NO-234, TICKET-1234).
  5. Commit message may include reference link (URL link).
